# OLX-searcher
Hello!

Since OLX does not have a dedicated API I've created a simple app (scraper and parser with some basic GUI) that displays all offers that are currently listed for a certain item.

You can search for as many items as you want simultaneously.

Scraping and parsing is done by requests and BeautifulSoup libraries. GUI was designed in PyQT designer and then modified to suit my needs (adding functionality etc.).

Here's how it looks in action:
